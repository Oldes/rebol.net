=These might be good ways to get the most from the wiki=


==Reference Card==

This is [http://www.tinyurl.com/2ltqps a good reference page for mediaWiki syntax]


==Use Categories==

Start to use Categories like the one at the bottom of this page to allow separation of a large number of pages

==DAL==

Install the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Dynamic_Article_List DAL extension] which gives some good recent changes view within categories  - it is the base for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki Semantic Wiki]

==Use Templates==

They are easy to do and get standardized and flexible format


==To Do in the wiki content==

[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Todo_Tasks this one] looks useful for ToDo items embedded in the documentation (but haven't tried it).

==Embedded Content Re-use==

Embedded pages work well - here is how to embed another article content - R3 Releases

<nowiki>{{:R3 Releases}}</nowiki>

==Standards Approach on Wiki==

The [http://standards-catalogue.ukoln.ac.uk/index/JISC_Standards_Catalogue JISC Standards Catalogue on mediaWiki] looks like a good example including a PrintAll option which pulls them together (hopefully dynamically using the wiki engine)
