'''on-over''' is invoked every time the mouse moves over or away from the face and is not performing dragging.

If the face has the ALL-OVER value specified as TRUE, this actor will be run continuously as long as the mouse is over the face. If ALL-OVER is FALSE (default), it does not report continuously, when over the face, but only on enter and exit.

As standard, the on-over sets the face/state/mode to 'over or 'up and then draws the face. This is useful, during '''[[The Face Object Field - Actors - on-draw|on-draw]]''' to set a face appearance on face/state/mode.

An input argument would be the offset or NONE.

A return value is not necessary.

It is invoked just after the '''[[The Face Object Field - Actors - on-move|on-move]]''' event.

===Examples===

Standard on-over actor:

<pre>
on-over: [
  face/state/mode: pick [over up] face/state/over not not arg
  draw-face
  none
]
</pre>
