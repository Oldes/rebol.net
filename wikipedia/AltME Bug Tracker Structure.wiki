{{Cookbook|title=AltMe Bug Tracker Structure|author=Henrik Mikael Kristensen|level=2|category=RT Developer}}

This document describes the structure of the data file for the AltME bug tracker available to R3 developers. It may be useful for scripts where we need to extract information from the tracker for display in other ways than normally available.

== Track.set File ==

The '''track.set''' file contains all bug reports for the r3-alpha world. It's available in your AltME directory under '''worlds/r3-alpha/track/track.set'''.

If your script is located in a directory relative to where track.set resides, you can always CHANGE-DIR to the track directory relatively and then use this line to load the track.set file into your script:

<pre>
tracker-data: load/all %track.set
</pre>

Then to read each bug report, start from the second element in TRACKER-DATA:

<pre>
foreach report next tracker-data [
  ; parse report
]
</pre>

== Report Structure ==

If you were to PARSE a single report, the structure is like this:

<pre>
parse report [
  set bug-number      integer!   ; Bug Number
  set bug-modified    date!      ; Bug Modification Date
                      integer!   ; Unknown
                      into [
                        integer! ; Unknown
  set bug-status        integer! ; Status
  set bug-severity      integer! ; Severity
  set bug-difficulty    integer! ; Difficulty
  set bug-priority      integer! ; Priority
                      ]
                      into [
  set bug-project       integer! ; Project
  set bug-version       string!  ; Version
  set bug-platform      integer! ; Platform
  set bug-area          string!  ; Area
                      ]
                      into [
  set bug-subject       string!  ; Bug Subject
  set bug-description   string!  ; Bug Description
  set bug-response      string!  ; Bug Response
                      ]
                      into [
  set bug-poster        string!  ; Bug Poster
  set bug-created       date!    ; Bug Posting Date
                        word!    ; Unknown
                      ]
                      into [
                        string!  ; Unknown
                        integer! ; Unknown
                      ]
]
</pre>

== Word Blocks ==

Some integers in the parse block above are representing values in the following blocks:

<pre>
types:     [Bug Wish Issue Note Nuts]
statuses:  [Submitted Reviewed Problem Waiting Deferred Dismissed Pending Built Tested Complete]
projects:  ["AltME" "AltServe" "WNS Server" "User Guide" "Website" "Other Code"]
platforms: ["All" "N/A" "Windows" "Mac OSX" "Linux x86 libc6" "FreeBSD x86"]
</pre>

You can copy this structure into your own script for easy parsing of a bug report.
