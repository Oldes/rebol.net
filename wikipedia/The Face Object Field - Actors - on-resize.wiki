'''on-resize''' is invoked, every time the layout is resized by the layout engine. Set the dimensions for the draw block as well as the size of the face GOB in this actor.

The input argument is the new size of the face as a pair!.

No return value is necessary.

If your style is a compound style, the faces inside may also need to be resized, which is done with the RESIZE-PANEL function.

===Examples===

Resizing a single face:

<pre>
on-resize: [
  face/gob/size: arg
  set-facet face 'size arg
  set-facet face 'area-size arg - 2   
]
</pre>

Resizing a compound face with scrollers:

<pre>
on-resize: [
  resize-panel face arg
  update-scrollers face face/gob
]
</pre>
