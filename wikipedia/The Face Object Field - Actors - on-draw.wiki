'''on-draw''' allows you to perform an action, typically a manipulation of the draw block of the face, just before the face is drawn. on-draw occurs every time DRAW-FACE is invoked.

The input argument is the draw block and it must be returned from on-draw.

When the on-draw actor has finished, the face is redrawn.

===Examples===

A plain empty on-draw actor:

<pre>
on-draw: [
  arg ; return value
]
</pre>

If the face state is 'up, we want to display a bright face. If the face state is 'down, we want to display a darker face, to indicate the face has been pressed.

<pre>
on-draw: [
  if face/state = 'up [set-facet face 'color 200.200.200]
  if face/state = 'down [set-facet face 'color 160.160.160]
  arg ; return value
]
</pre>
