'''on-attach''' is invoked when this face gets attached to another face, which usually happens during '''[[The Face Object Field - Actors - on-init|on-init]]''' for the other face.

The input is the face requesting attachment. No return value is necessary.

===Examples===

Attaching a SCROLLER to the style:

<pre>
on-attach: [ ; arg: scroller
  ; Called when scroll bar auto attaches:
  extend-face face 'attached arg
  update-scrollers face sub-gob? face
]
</pre>

For the SCROLLER, the code to attach adds a SCROLL reactor to the target style through its '''[[The Face Object Field - Actors - on-init|on-init]]''':

<pre>
on-init: [
  ; Find a prior face to attach the scroll bar to:
  if target: find-face-actor/reverse face 'on-scroll [
    append-face-act face reduce ['scroll target]
    do-style target 'on-attach face
  ]
]
</pre>
