'''on-clear''' is invoked when a face needs to be cleared. It can be used with the CLEAR reactor. It is also invoked when a panel of form elements needs to be cleared with the CLEAR-PANEL function.

There is no input argument. A return value is not necessary.

===Examples===

<pre>
on-clear: [
  clear face/facets/text-edit
  show-later face
]
</pre>
