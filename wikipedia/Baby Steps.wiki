'''This is an important note to all alpha testers:'''

Test R3 one step at a time. Start with:

<pre>
>> 1 + 2
== 3
</pre>

Then try:

<pre>
>> a: 1
>> a + 2
== 3
</pre>

Ever see the movie, ''What about Bob?''. Well: '''Baby steps.''' That's the mindset.

That's what you need to do. Don't do more.

Don't <tt>do</tt> your largest script. '''''We guarantee it won't work.'''''

Don't try obscure complex functions. They won't work! Guaranteed.

Take things just one small little step at a time. Find all those little bugs first. We'll get those little ones fixed, then move to the next baby step.
