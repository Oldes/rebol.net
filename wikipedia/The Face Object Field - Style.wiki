===Style===

'''Face/style''' is the name of the style, not the style object. It's implemented this way mainly for debugging reasons: if you print the face, you don't have to see the entire style specification, which can be fairly long.

For example, a button object would have:

<pre>
style: 'button
</pre>

The map between style names and their definitions is stored in the main module object for the GUI system. New styles can be added to this map as needed.
