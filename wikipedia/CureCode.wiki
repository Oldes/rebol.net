For bug reports and enhancement requests.

==Summary==

For 3.0 bug reporting and enhancement requests we use '''CureCode''', written and hosted by [http://softinnov.org/ Softinnov].

The web site interface can be found at http://curecode.org/rebol3/

==Basics==

It's pretty obvious when you look at it.

'''No account is needed''' to view and search tickets.

'''To submit or change a ticket requires an account.''' But, it is easy and fast [http://curecode.org/rebol3/register.rsp to register] (also via the link at the top of the page.)

You can also modify the state of tickets that you've submitted earlier.

==Questions==

*Q:
**Does it have a Rebol interface?
**Although it runs in Rebol via the Cheyenne web server, there is currently no direct Rebol interface, but there are plans to add it later.
*Q:
**Can it be enhanced?
**Several enhancements have already been made, and you can submit your suggestions to Softinnov. In addition, the source code is available, so you can help with bugs and enhancements.

==API documentation==
<blockquote>
''Main features :''
* ''retrieve a list of tickets based on preset filters''
* ''retrieve whole details about a given ticket ID''
* ''returned data are in Rebol format (XML support pending)''
* ''doesn't support yet adding or modifying tickets''

''The current API should be considered alpha.''
</blockquote>

===Query format===

CureCode API URLs must be in the following format:

<pre>
    http://curecode.org/rebol3/api.rsp?<parameter 1>&<parameter 2>&<parameter n>
</pre>

Parameters are separated using the ampersand character (&). You can specify as many parameters as you like, in any order. Parameters can be passed in URL or as POST data.

===Response format===

All responses are encapsulated using the following format :

    [<status> <data>]
    </pre>	
    <span style="color:green">'''<tt><status></tt>'''</span> is a ''word!'' value informing about the completion of the request :
    <blockquote>
    * '''<tt>ok</tt>''' : valid request, <span style="color:green">'''<tt><data></tt>'''</span> can be a ''block!'' or ''integer!'' value.
    * '''<tt>error</tt>''' : invalid request, <span style="color:green">'''<tt><data></tt>'''</span> will be a ''string!'' containing an error message.
    
    <pre>
    [ok 492]
    [ok [403 202 404]]
    [ok [summary: "Crash calling BROWSE function" description:...]]
    
    [error "FILTER argument is invalid"]
    

You can use LOAD to query the remote API and get Rebol data back. If you don't trust the server, you can use LOAD/ALL or READ instead.

    >> load http://curecode.org/rebol3/api.rsp?type=list&filter=2&mode=count
    == [ok 492]
    
    >> read http://curecode.org/rebol3/api.rsp?type=list&filter=2&mode=count
    == "[ok 492]"
